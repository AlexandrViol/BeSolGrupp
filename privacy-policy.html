                <p>
                    Some of our products help users to make data exchange of
                    their desktop software with cloud-based services. In such
                    products, BeSol Grupp does not obtain nor collect any
                    personal or other information of users, except their
                    personal data that are required to identify them as
                    registered users of our products. Each time we do so we ask
                    the user for explicit consent to provide us with this
                    information in conformance with this Privacy Policy.
